0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

In this project, I have implemented some of the Control Flow Tools in my programs that is the if/elif/else, loops and functions.

0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
	Used random a python module to generate random numbers from -10 to but not 10.
- For all positive numbers printed, 'is positive' is stated
- For all negative numbers printed, 'is negative' is stated
- For 0, 'is zero' is stated

1. The last digit
	Check whether last digit of a random number generated by the Random python model is greater than 5, equal to 0 and less than 6 but greater than 0.

2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
	print a string of alphabets without a next line

3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off
	Print a string of alphabets but excluding q and e then dont skip to next line

4. Hexadecimal printing
	print number followed by its hexadecimal equivalent

5. 00...99
	print numbers 01 to 99 followed by a new line

6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need
	prints a combination of integers ensuring that no duplication is done yet numbers are arranged in ascending order

7. islower
	A function that checks for lowercase character

8. To uppercase
	Afunction that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line

9. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important
	Print last digits of a number

10. a + b
	Add two numbers and return their result

11. a^b
	Compute a to the power of b and return the result
